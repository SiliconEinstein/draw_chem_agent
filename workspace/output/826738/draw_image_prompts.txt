The image is split into two panels side-by-side, labeled 'Associative (Vitrimer)' and 'Dissociative'. Both panels initially show a segment of a polymer network with crosslinks. A symbol for a stimulus (e.g., a temperature icon 'ΔT') initiates the process. In the 'Associative' panel, an incoming reactive group is shown attacking an existing crosslink, forming a transient intermediate state with a higher coordination number, which then resolves into a new crosslink configuration without ever breaking the overall network connectivity. In the 'Dissociative' panel, a crosslink is shown first breaking into two separate reactive ends (dissociation), which then wander apart before recombining to form a new crosslink (association). Arrows clearly indicate the reaction pathways. Use blue for polymer chains and red for the dynamic crosslink bonds, set against a white background.",
